# Introduction

MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database. It means that it's a database that isn't relational and doesn't have a query language like SQL. MongoDB is
a Document Oriented Database. It promises to be a database of choice for large unstructured data. It is designed for ease of development and scaling.
It obviates the need of [Object Relational Mapping (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) to facilitate development.

## Documents

A document is a data strucuture composed of fields and value pairs. It is similar to a JSON onject. The value fields in a document may include other
documents. For example,

```
{
	"name": "Deepak",
	"age": 22,
	"address": {
		"house no": "some number",
		"street": "street",
		"city": "some city"
	}
}
```

## Collections

The documents in MongoDB are stored in what is called as a collection. Collection, as the name suggests, is a collection of documents. A collection
is analogous to a table in ralational databases. Although, unlike in tables, the documents in a collection can have different schema. Every document
in a collection must have a unique_id which acts as a primary to distinguish a document. A collection contains many entries similar to the document
mentioned above.
