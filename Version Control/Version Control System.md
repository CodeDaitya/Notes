## Version Control System

Version Control is the process of keeping the history of ones work in manner that one can keep a track of all the changes.
The work files are stored in a seperate database usually called repository. Since the files are stored seperately from the
local work environment, any progress that one might want to revert can be done using the copy stored in the repository. Also,
the sharing of the file becomes very convenient allowing better collaboration with a team one might be working with.

A Version Control System handles all the requirements of Version Control. It has the capability of handling all the changes
coming from different sources and maintain the integrity of the data stored in the seperate database.

### Reverting Changes
The changes one make to a local database can be reverted. 

### Branching
This feature allows creating a seperate branch of the work directory and make any experinmental changes on this new branch without
effecting the current version of the work files. It's possible to work on different branches and once the new branch is in a desirabel state
it can be merged with the main branch, thereby creating a new version of the project.
