## Version Control System

Version Control is the process of keeping the history of ones work in manner that one can keep a track of all the changes.
The work files are stored in a seperate database usually called repository. Since the files are stored seperately from the
local work environment, any progress that one might want to revert can be done using the copy stored in the repository. Also,
the sharing of the file becomes very convenient allowing better collaboration with a team one might be working with.
